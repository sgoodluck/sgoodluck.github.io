Hi, I'm Seth and this is my blog.


## About tgcg.xyz {#about-tgcg-dot-xyz}

_Disclaimer: The contents here are always evolving and you may encounter opinions that I no longer hold or find advice that is no longer valid_

The purpose of this blog is to give me a space to write about whatever I want. My interests (and hence the content you might encounter) are broad and cover everything from politics &amp; philosophy to computer science &amp; physics, to exercise &amp; travel.

_Disclaimer 2: You will encounter my unfiltered opinions._

Some you might find agreeable, others amusing, and others upsetting. My purpose isn't to impress you, it is to express myself.

Having said that, I hope some of the content proves useful for you. Many times I have searched for something to eventually chance upon a blog written by some stranger on the internet who shared exactly the advice or guide I needed.

This blog is in no small part my way of giving back to our collective digital mind with useful nuggets I've picked up along the way.


### The Good Code Guy {#the-good-code-guy}

Why this title? Well, it happens to be cute sounding, I have an email that corresponds to it (GoodCodeGuy@pm.me if you want to reach out), and perhaps most importantly is an accurate reflection of something I care a lot about.


## About me {#about-me}

I'm a professional software engineer, serial entrepreneur, and all-around nerd.

I love writing, exercise, programming, learning, exploring, traveling, photography, and much more.

My degree is in Computer Science Engineering &amp; Global Entrepreneurship (a mouthful, I know) and my Alma mater is Cornell University.
