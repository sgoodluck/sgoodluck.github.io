Hi, I'm Seth and this is my blog.


## About tgcg.xyz {#about-tgcg-dot-xyz}

_My primary disclaimer is that the contents herein are ever evolving and that you may encounter opinions that I no longer hold and be offerred advice that is no longer warranted._

The purpose of this blog is to give me a space to write about whatever I want to write about. My interests (and hence the content you might encounter) are broad and cover everything from politics &amp; philosophy to computer science &amp; physics.

_The secondary disclaimer is that you will encounter my unfiltered opinions about many topics._

Some of these you might find agreeable, others amusing, and potentially some upsetting. That's fine. My purpose isn't to impress you, it is purely to express myself (onlookers be damned).

That being said, I do hope that some of the content here proves illuminating for you. Many a time I have searched desperately for something to eventually chance upon a blog written by some stranger on the internet who shared exactly the advice or guide I needed. This blog is in no small part my way of trying to give back to our collective digital mind some useful nuggets I pick up along the way.


### The Good Code Guy {#the-good-code-guy}

Why this title? Well, it happens to be cute sounding, I have an email that corresponds to that, and it is an accurate reflection of something I care a lot about.


## About me {#about-me}

I'm a professional software engineer with over a decade of experience, serial entrepreneur, and all-around nerd.

I love writing, exercise, programming, learning, exploring, traveling, photography, and much more.

My degree is in Computer Science Engineering &amp; Global Entrepreneurship (a mouthful, I know) and my alma mater is Cornell University.


## Hi Alessandra! {#hi-alessandra}
