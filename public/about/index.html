My interests (and hence the content you might encounter) are broad and cover everything from politics & philosophy to computer science & physics.</p><p><em>The secondary disclaimer is that you will encounter my unfiltered opinions about many topics.</em></p><p>Some of these you might find agreeable, others amusing, and potentially some upsetting. That&rsquo;s fine. My purpose isn&rsquo;t to impress you, it is purely to express myself (onlookers be damned).</p><p>That being said, I do hope that some of the content here proves illuminating for you. Many a time I have searched desperately for something to eventually chance upon a blog written by some stranger on the internet who shared exactly the advice or guide I needed. This blog is in no small part my way of trying to give back to our collective digital mind with some useful nuggets I pick up along the way.</p><h3 id=the-good-code-guy>The Good Code Guy</h3><p>Why this title? Well, it happens to be cute sounding, I have an email that corresponds to that, and it is an accurate reflection of something I care a lot about.</p><h2 id=about-me>About me</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a professional software engineer with over a decade of experience, serial entrepreneur, and all-around nerd.</p><p>I love writing, exercise, programming, learning, exploring, traveling, photography, and much more.</p><p>My degree is in Computer Science Engineering & Global Entrepreneurship (a mouthful, I know) and my alma mater is Cornell University.</p><h2 id=hi-alessandra>Hi Alessandra!</h2><p>I love you :)</p></div></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://tgcg.xyz/><b>The Good Code Guy</b></a>.
