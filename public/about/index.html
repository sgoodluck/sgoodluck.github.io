    <h1 class="post-title">About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Seth and this is my blog.</p>
<h2 id="about-tgcg-dot-xyz">About tgcg.xyz</h2>
<p><em>My primary disclaimer is that the contents here are always evolving and you may encounter opinions that I no longer hold or find advice that is no longer valid.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to give me a space to write about whatever I want. My interests (and hence the content you might encounter) are broad and cover everything from politics &amp; philosophy to computer science &amp; physics.</p>
<p><em>The secondary disclaimer is that you will encounter my unfiltered opinions about many topics.</em></p>
<p>Some of these you might find agreeable, others amusing, and some upsetting. That&rsquo;s fine. My purpose isn&rsquo;t to impress you, it is purely to express myself.</p>
<p>Having said that, I hope some of the content here proves useful for you. Many times I have searched desperately for something to eventually chance upon a blog written by some stranger on the internet who shared exactly the advice or guide I needed. This blog is in no small part also my way of trying to give back to our collective digital mind with useful nuggets I&rsquo;ve picked up along the way.</p>
<h3 id="the-good-code-guy">The Good Code Guy</h3>
<p>Why this title? Well, it happens to be cute sounding, I have an email that corresponds to it (<a href="mailto:GoodCodeGuy@pm.me">GoodCodeGuy@pm.me</a> if you want to reach out), and perhaps most importantly is an accurate reflection of something I care a lot about.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professional software engineer, serial entrepreneur, and all-around nerd.</p>
<p>I love writing, exercise, programming, learning, exploring, traveling, photography, and much more.</p>
<p>My degree is in Computer Science Engineering &amp; Global Entrepreneurship (a mouthful, I know) and my Alma mater is Cornell University.</p>
