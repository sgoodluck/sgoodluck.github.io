&lt;p>We live in a world dominated by the too-quick-to-offend and the offended-too-quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reality, however, is multi-faceted, each face colored by individual experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our capacity to understand this nuance has lagged behind our access to virtually infinite information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is a breakdown in society, with sects colored by worldviews orchestrated by an unconscious engagement machine, mechanically feeding us whatever data fuels focus and engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the light, this technologically doped filtering is a godsend &amp;ndash; we can find products we love, information we need, people we enjoy, and perspectives we harbor; we become coddled in an instant with whatever cranial comfort we desire.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
