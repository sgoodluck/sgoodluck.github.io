&lt;p>&lt;em>My primary disclaimer is that the contents herein are ever evolving and that you may encounter opinions that I no longer hold and be offerred advice that is no longer warranted.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of this blog is to give me a space to write about whatever I want to write about. My interests (and hence the content you might encounter) are broad and cover everything from politics &amp;amp; philosophy to computer science &amp;amp; physics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Truth In Tension</title><link>https://tgcg.xyz/posts/truth-in-tension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tgcg.xyz/posts/truth-in-tension/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We live in a world dominated by the too-quick-to-offend and the offended-too-quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reality, however, is multi-faceted, each face colored by individual experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our capacity to understand this nuance has lagged behind our access to virtually infinite information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is a breakdown in society, with sects colored by worldviews orchestrated by an unconscious engagement machine, mechanically feeding us whatever data fuels focus and engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the light, this technologically doped filtering is a godsend &amp;ndash; we can find products we love, information we need, people we enjoy, and perspectives we harbor; we become coddled in an instant with whatever cranial comfort we desire.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
